Concordian: BDD Framework

Ref: https://concordion.org/tutorial/java/markdown/

It is 4 step process:
	1.Discussing
	2.Documenting
	3.Instrumenting
	4.Coding


1.Discussing: 
			Collaboratively specifying examples.
			Before developing a new feature, discussing behavioural examples helps teams to build the feature right first time. Issues and requirements gaps are detected and misunderstandings corrected before the team starts developing code and tests.
			
	a: Acceptance Criteria and Examples:
	   When discussing a feature, it helps to describe the "desired behaviour" in general terms as "acceptance criteria", along with specific "examples".
	   
	   For instance, 
				Acceptance criteria:
						"All orders of $50 or over receive free shipping". 
						In simple (order.value > 50$) ? shipping = free : pay
				Examples: 
						"a $49.99 order has to pay for shipping” 
						"a $50.00 order has free shipping"

	   Note: "Each example relates to an acceptance criterion" and "Each acceptance criterion has corresponding examples".
	   
	b: Structure / Anatomy of an Example:
	   For each "example", you should consider the:
	   1.Context
	   2.Action
	   3.Outcome:

	   1. Context describes the preconditions that are in place for the example to take place. You should consider not only the application state, but also any relevant global conditions such as the day of week, or the location of the user.
	   2. Action describes the event you are testing.
	   3. Outcome describes the expected postconditions that should hold true.
	   
	   When discussing "examples", we need to consider the context (preconditions), actions and outcomes for each example. 
	   we are working on a system for creating marketing mailshots. We want to have the first name and last name of the customer. Unfortunately the customer data that we are supplied only contains "full names", so we will need to "split" them.
	   In this example, the "context" is the name "Jane Smith", the "action" is "split" and the "outcomes" are the "first name Jane" and "last name Smith".
	   
	c. Exploring examples:
	
	   "conversational patterns"
	   1. Context Questioning
		  Asking "Is there any other 'context' which, when this event happens, will produce a different outcome?" 
		  Helps us think of new scenarios.
		  example: "John dave smith" is context, and "action" is "split" what is the outcome ?

	   2.Outcome Questioning
		  Asking "Given this context, when this event happens, is there 'another outcome' that’s important? Something we missed, perhaps?" 
		  Helps us find other things that our software should do.
		  Example: Does split of user name trigger anything else apart from split operation ? like audit and do we need to check audit?

2.Documenting (specification)
	This is known as "specification".
	Small Note:
		The # characters at the start of the line create headings, where the heading level/Size is determined by the number of # characters.
		The lines without a # character are treated as plain paragraphs.

3.Instrumenting
	To make the "specification" executable, it must be "instrumented with commands". The instrumentation is processed by the "fixture" code.
	
	The first step is to select the "words" in the "example" that define the "context" (preconditions), "actions" and "outcomes". 
	Example, 
			"context" is the name "Jane Smith"
			"action" is broken 
			"outcomes" are the 'first name' "Jane" and 'last name' "Smith". 

	Markdown Syntax:
	The full name [Jane Smith]() is [broken]() into first name [Jane]() and last name [Smith]().
	
	
	markdown syntax:
	1. __bold text__
	2. Links
		a. [links](http://wikipedia.org)
		b. reference type links:
			[value][id]
			[id]: - "http://wikipedia.org"
	3. *emphasis*
	4. **strong**
	5. * list
	6. >block quote
	7. code (4 spaces indent)
	
	Next, we add "Concordion commands" to the "links"
	
	Example MD:
	The full name [Jane Smith](- "#name") is [broken](- "#result = split(#name)") 
	into first name [Jane](- "?=#result.firstName") and last name [Smith](- "?=#result.lastName").
	
	Summary of this above command is:
		Setting our "context", by setting a new variable #name to the value Jane Smith
		Executing our "action", by executing the method split() with the variable #name and returning the value #result
		Verifying our "outcomes", by checking whether #result.firstName is set to Jane, and #result.lastName is set to Smith.

4. Coding
   AKA - "fixture"
   Create some code, called a "fixture", that 'links' the "instrumented specification" with the system under test.
